## Patents

### Types of Patents

| Type | Subject Matter | Term |
|------|---------------|------|
| Utility | Processes, machines, manufactures, compositions | 20 years from filing |
| Design | Ornamental design of functional item | 15 years from grant |
| Plant | New plant varieties | 20 years from filing |

### Patentability Requirements

**35 U.S.C. § 101 — Patentable Subject Matter:**
- Process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter
- NOT: Laws of nature, natural phenomena, abstract ideas

**35 U.S.C. § 102 — Novelty:**
- Not previously known or used
- Not described in prior publication
- Not on sale or in public use before filing

**35 U.S.C. § 103 — Non-Obviousness:**
- Would not be obvious to person of ordinary skill in the art
- Consider: Scope of prior art, differences, level of skill

**35 U.S.C. § 112 — Specification:**
- Written description
- Enablement (teach how to make/use)
- Best mode
- Claims (define scope of protection)

### Patent Process

1. **Invention disclosure**: Document the invention
2. **Prior art search**: Check existing patents and publications
3. **Provisional application** (optional): 12-month placeholder, establishes priority
4. **Non-provisional application**: Full application with claims
5. **Examination**: USPTO reviews, issues office actions
6. **Prosecution**: Respond to rejections, amend claims
7. **Issuance**: Patent granted
8. **Maintenance fees**: Due at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years

**Timeline:** Average 2-3 years from filing to issuance

**Costs:** $10,000-$30,000+ (attorney fees + USPTO fees)

### Patent Strategy

**When to patent:**
- Novel, non-obvious invention
- Can be reverse-engineered
- Long commercial life
- Willing to disclose publicly

**When to use trade secret instead:**
- Process that can't be reverse-engineered
- Continuous improvement expected
- Can maintain secrecy
- Longer than 20-year protection needed

### Patent vs Trade Secret

| Factor | Patent | Trade Secret |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Duration | 20 years | Indefinite |
| Cost | High ($10K-30K+) | Low (security measures) |
| Disclosure | Required (public) | Must remain secret |
| Independent invention | Infringement | Not infringement |
| Reverse engineering | Infringement | Not infringement |
| Enforcement | Litigation | Litigation + injunctions |

## Trademarks

### What Can Be Trademarked

**Protectable:**
- Words and names
- Logos and symbols
- Slogans and taglines
- Product packaging (trade dress)
- Colors (if distinctive)
- Sounds

**NOT protectable:**
- Generic terms
- Merely descriptive terms (without secondary meaning)
- Functional features
- Deceptive marks

### Trademark Spectrum

5. **Registration**: Certificate issued (or Statement of Use if intent-to-use)

**Bases for filing:**
- Use in commerce: Already using the mark
- Intent to use: Plan to use (must file Statement of Use within 6 months, extendable)

**Timeline:** 8-12 months (if no issues)

**Costs:** $250-350 per class (USPTO) + attorney fees

### Maintaining Registration

## Trade Secrets

### Definition

**Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA):**

1. Derives independent economic value from not being generally known
2. Is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy

### Examples of Trade Secrets

- Pricing information
- Manufacturing processes
- Formulas and recipes
- Business strategies
- Software algorithms
- Negative know-how (what doesn't work)

### Protection Measures

**Reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy:**
- Confidentiality agreements (employees, contractors, partners)
- Physical security (locked areas, access controls)
- Electronic security (passwords, encryption, access logs)
- Need-to-know access limitations
- Exit interviews and reminders
- Document marking ("Confidential")
- Employee training

### Misappropriation

**Improper means:**
- Theft
- Bribery
- Misrepresentation
- Breach of duty to maintain secrecy
- Espionage

**NOT improper:**
- Independent invention
- Reverse engineering (of lawfully acquired product)
- Public observation

### DTSA (Federal) vs State Law

**DTSA (2016):**
- Federal cause of action
- Ex parte seizure provision
- Whistleblower immunity

**State laws (UTSA adopted in 48 states):**
- Similar protections
- May have different statute of limitations
- New York and North Carolina use common law

### Remedies

- Injunctive relief (prevent further disclosure)
- Damages (actual loss + unjust enrichment)
- Reasonable royalty
- Exemplary damages (up to 2x for willful misappropriation)
- Attorneys' fees (if willful and malicious)

## IP in Employment

### Invention Assignment

**Best practice:** Written agreement requiring assignment of:
- Inventions related to company business
- Inventions using company resources
- Inventions made during employment

**State limitations:**

**California (Labor Code § 2870):**
Cannot require assignment of inventions:
- Developed entirely on employee's own time
- Without using company resources
- Unrelated to company's business
- Not resulting from work performed for company

Similar laws: Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, and others

### Non-Disclosure Obligations

**During employment:**
- Implied duty of confidentiality
- Strengthen with written NDA

**After employment:**
- No implied duty (absent trade secret)
- Must have written agreement
- Cannot prevent use of general skills/knowledge

### IP Due Diligence (M&A/Investment)

**Key questions:**
1. Who owns the IP? (employees, founders, contractors)
2. Are assignments properly documented?
3. Any third-party claims or licenses?
4. Are registrations current?
5. Any pending litigation?
6. Open source usage?
