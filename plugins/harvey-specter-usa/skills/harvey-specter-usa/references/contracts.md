# Contract Law — US Practice

## Overview

This reference covers contract formation, interpretation, common clauses, and remedies under US law (UCC and common law).

---

## Contract Formation

### Essential Elements

1. **Offer**: Definite terms, intent to be bound
2. **Acceptance**: Mirror image (common law) or reasonable (UCC)
3. **Consideration**: Bargained-for exchange of value
4. **Capacity**: Legal ability to contract
5. **Legality**: Lawful purpose

### UCC vs Common Law

| Aspect | UCC Article 2 | Common Law |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Applies to | Sale of goods | Services, real estate, IP |
| Acceptance | Can modify terms | Mirror image rule |
| Statute of Frauds | Goods ≥$500 | Varies by contract type |
| Gap fillers | UCC provides missing terms | Must be definite |
| Merchant rules | Special rules for merchants | N/A |

**Mixed contracts:** Predominant purpose test — what's the main subject?

## Statute of Frauds

### Must Be in Writing

**Common Law (varies by state):**
- Contracts for sale of land
- Contracts not performable within 1 year
- Promises to pay debt of another (suretyship)
- Contracts in consideration of marriage
- Executor promises to pay estate debts personally

**UCC § 2-201:**
- Sale of goods ≥$500
- Exceptions: Specially manufactured goods, admission in court, partial performance

## Contract Interpretation

### Hierarchy of Evidence

1. Express terms of contract
2. Course of performance (same contract)
3. Course of dealing (prior contracts)
4. Trade usage

### Interpretation Rules

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Plain meaning | Unambiguous terms enforced as written |
| Four corners | Look to document, not extrinsic evidence (if unambiguous) |
| Contra proferentem | Ambiguity construed against drafter |
| Specific over general | Specific provisions control general |
| Handwritten over printed | Handwritten terms prevail |
| Reasonable interpretation | Prefer interpretation that makes contract valid |

### Parol Evidence Rule

**Integrated agreement:** Final written expression of parties' agreement

**Parol evidence excluded for:**
- Prior negotiations
- Prior agreements
- Contemporaneous oral agreements

**Exceptions (parol evidence allowed for):**
- Fraud, duress, mistake
- Condition precedent to contract formation
- Subsequent modifications
- Ambiguous terms (to clarify, not contradict)
- Partial integration (additional consistent terms)

## Essential Contract Clauses

### Representations and Warranties

**Representations:** Statements of fact at signing
**Warranties:** Promises about future or ongoing conditions

```
Seller represents and warrants that:
(a) It has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement;
(b) This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation;
(c) The execution of this Agreement does not violate any other agreement.
```

**Survival:** Reps and warranties typically survive closing for 12-24 months

### Indemnification

**Purpose:** Shift risk of third-party claims

**Standard indemnification:**
```
Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to [scope].
```

**Key negotiations:**
- Scope of covered claims
- Caps on liability
- Baskets/deductibles
- Notice requirements
- Control of defense

### Limitation of Liability

**Types of limitations:**
1. **Consequential damages waiver**: No indirect, special, punitive
2. **Cap on liability**: Dollar amount (often contract value or fees paid)
3. **Time limitation**: Claims must be brought within X years

**Carve-outs (typically unlimited):**
- Indemnification obligations
- Breach of confidentiality
- IP infringement
- Gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Fraud

**Sample clause:**
```
IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. EACH PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY
SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS
PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
```

### Termination

**Termination for convenience:**
- Either party can terminate with notice (30-90 days typical)
- May require payment for work performed

**Termination for cause:**
- Material breach (with cure period, typically 30 days)
- Insolvency or bankruptcy
- Change of control

**Effect of termination:**
- Identify surviving provisions
- Transition obligations
- Return of confidential information

### Confidentiality

**Standard elements:**
```
"Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by
one party to the other, including [examples]. Confidential Information
does not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available
through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known to the receiving
party prior to disclosure; (c) is independently developed without use of
Confidential Information; or (d) is received from a third party without
breach of any obligation of confidentiality.
```

**Obligations:**
- Use only for permitted purpose
- Protect with reasonable care (at least same as own confidential info)
- Limit access to need-to-know
- Return or destroy upon termination

**Term:** Typically 2-5 years, or indefinite for trade secrets

### Intellectual Property

**Work for hire:**
```
All Work Product created by Contractor under this Agreement shall be
deemed "work made for hire" as defined in the Copyright Act. To the extent
any Work Product does not qualify as work made for hire, Contractor hereby
assigns to Company all right, title, and interest in and to such Work Product.
```

**License grants:**
- Exclusive vs non-exclusive
- Scope (field of use, territory)
- Sublicense rights
- Reservation of rights

**IP ownership:**
- Background IP: Stays with original owner
- Foreground IP: Assign to customer or joint ownership
- Improvements: Often assigned to IP owner

laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
```

### Forum Selection

**Types:**
- Exclusive: Only that forum
- Non-exclusive: That forum, but others allowed

**Options:**
- State courts (specific court, e.g., Delaware Chancery)
- Federal courts
- Arbitration

**Sample clause:**
```
The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware for any disputes arising
out of or relating to this Agreement.
```

### Arbitration

**Advantages:**
- Privacy
- Speed (sometimes)
- Specialized arbitrators
- Limited discovery

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited appeal rights
- Can be expensive

## Breach & Remedies

### Types of Breach

| Type | Definition | Remedy |
|------|------------|--------|
| Material | Goes to essence, defeats purpose | Terminate + damages |

### Remedies

**Damages:**
1. **Compensatory**: Put non-breaching party in position if performed
2. **Consequential**: Foreseeable indirect damages
3. **Liquidated**: Pre-agreed amount (must be reasonable estimate)
4. **Nominal**: Token amount when no actual loss

**Equitable:**
1. **Specific performance**: Court orders performance (rare, unique goods)
2. **Injunction**: Court prohibits action
3. **Rescission**: Cancel contract, restore parties to pre-contract position
4. **Reformation**: Court rewrites contract to reflect intent

### Liquidated Damages

**Enforceable if:**
