## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Question Presented

**Format:** Under [jurisdiction/law], [legal question] when [key facts]?

**Good example:**
> Under Delaware law, does a corporation's failure to hold an annual meeting for three consecutive years constitute grounds for involuntary dissolution when the corporation has continued to conduct regular business operations?

**Bad example:**
> Is the company in trouble for not having meetings?

### Short Answer

**Format:** [Yes/No/Likely Yes/Likely No] + explanation with citations

**Good example:**
> Likely No. Under 8 Del. C. § 211, while Delaware corporations are required to hold annual meetings, the failure to do so does not automatically result in dissolution. The Court of Chancery may order a meeting upon stockholder petition (8 Del. C. § 211(c)), but involuntary dissolution under § 226 requires additional factors such as deadlock or fraud. Given that the corporation has continued operations without stockholder complaint, the risk of involuntary dissolution is low.

### Statement of Facts

**Include:**
- Parties and their relationships
- Chronology of relevant events
- Documents or agreements at issue
- Current status

**Exclude:**
- Legal conclusions
- Irrelevant background
- Speculation
- Advocacy

### Discussion

**IRAC Method:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **I**ssue | What legal question are we answering? |
| **R**ule | What law applies? (statute, case, regulation) |
| **A**pplication | How does the law apply to these facts? |
| **C**onclusion | What's the answer to this issue? |

### Risk Assessment

| Level | Probability | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **High** | >50% | More likely than not to occur; immediate attention needed |
| **Medium** | 25-50% | Substantial possibility; should be addressed |
| **Low** | 10-25% | Unlikely but possible; monitor |
| **Remote** | <10% | Theoretical risk only |

## Example Memo: Delaware Incorporation

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        MEMORANDUM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TO:         TechStart Inc.
FROM:       Harvey Specter
DATE:       January 20, 2026
RE:         Delaware vs. California Incorporation for Seed-Stage Startup

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

QUESTION PRESENTED

Under Delaware and California corporate law, should a seed-stage
technology startup with founders in California seeking venture
capital funding incorporate in Delaware or California?

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SHORT ANSWER

Delaware. While California incorporation would avoid foreign
qualification costs, Delaware offers superior advantages for
venture-backed startups: (1) the Court of Chancery provides
specialized, predictable business courts; (2) the DGCL offers
flexibility in corporate governance; (3) investors expect and
prefer Delaware entities; and (4) extensive case law reduces
legal uncertainty. The additional costs of Delaware incorporation
(~$1,500-2,000/year) are justified by these benefits.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STATEMENT OF FACTS

TechStart Inc. is a pre-seed software company with:
- Two founders, both California residents
- Operations conducted remotely, primarily in California
- Plans to raise seed funding ($1-2M) within 6 months
- Expectation of hiring 5-10 employees in Year 1
- No current revenue; pre-product stage

The founders seek advice on optimal jurisdiction for incorporation.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DISCUSSION

I. Delaware Advantages for Venture-Backed Startups

   A. Applicable Law

      Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), 8 Del. C. § 101
      et seq., governs Delaware corporations. The Court of
      Chancery, established in 1792, has exclusive jurisdiction
      over corporate disputes.

   B. Analysis

      Delaware offers four primary advantages:

      1. Specialized Courts: The Court of Chancery handles
         corporate disputes with judges (not juries) who have
         deep expertise in corporate law. Average resolution
         time is significantly faster than general jurisdiction
         courts.

      2. Predictable Law: Over 200 years of case law provides
         clear guidance on fiduciary duties, stockholder rights,
         and corporate governance. The business judgment rule
         is well-established and director-friendly.

      3. Flexible Statute: DGCL § 102(b)(7) allows exculpation
         of director liability for duty of care breaches.
         § 141 permits flexibility in board structure. § 151
         allows unlimited classes of stock.

      4. Investor Expectation: Standard venture documents
         (NVCA forms) assume Delaware law. VCs conduct
         diligence assuming Delaware governance structures.

   C. Risk Assessment: Low

      Risk of adverse outcome from Delaware incorporation is
      minimal. The jurisdiction is well-understood and accepted.

II. California Considerations

    A. Applicable Law

       California Corporations Code § 2115 ("pseudo-foreign
       corporation" statute) applies California law to certain
       internal affairs of corporations meeting specified
       thresholds (property, payroll, sales in California).

    B. Analysis

       TechStart will likely trigger § 2115 if more than 50%
       of its voting securities are held by California residents
       and it meets the property/payroll/sales test. However:

       1. § 2115 has uncertain enforceability after VantagePoint
          Venture Partners v. Examen (Del. 2005), which held
          Delaware law governs internal affairs.

       2. In practice, venture-backed startups routinely
          incorporate in Delaware regardless of § 2115.

       3. California qualification ($800 minimum franchise tax)
          is required regardless of incorporation state if
          doing business in California.

    C. Risk Assessment: Low

       § 2115 compliance creates some uncertainty but is
       manageable and rarely litigated for private companies.

III. Cost Comparison

     | Item | Delaware + CA Qual | CA Only |
     |------|-------------------|---------|
     | Initial filing | ~$250 | ~$100 |
     | Registered agent | $50-300/yr | N/A |
     | DE franchise tax | $175-400/yr | N/A |
     | CA franchise tax | $800/yr | $800/yr |
     | **Annual total** | ~$1,500-2,000 | ~$800 |

     The incremental cost of ~$700-1,200/year is negligible
     relative to seed funding amounts and the benefits obtained.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION

TechStart should incorporate in Delaware. The benefits of
Delaware incorporation—specialized courts, predictable law,
statutory flexibility, and investor acceptance—substantially
outweigh the modest incremental costs. This recommendation
aligns with industry standard practice for venture-backed
technology startups.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. Form Delaware C-Corp through registered agent (1-2 days)
2. Obtain EIN from IRS (same day, online)
3. Adopt bylaws and issue founder stock with vesting
4. File 83(b) elections within 30 days of stock issuance
5. Qualify as foreign corporation in California
6. Establish corporate records and banking

## Example Memo: Employment Classification

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                        MEMORANDUM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TO:         GrowthCo LLC
FROM:       Harvey Specter
DATE:       January 20, 2026
RE:         Classification of Marketing Consultant as Independent Contractor

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

QUESTION PRESENTED

Under federal law (IRS common law test) and California law
(ABC test), can GrowthCo properly classify a marketing consultant
who works 30 hours/week exclusively for GrowthCo, uses company
equipment, and follows company processes as an independent contractor?

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SHORT ANSWER

No. Under both federal and California standards, this worker
should be classified as an employee. The exclusive, ongoing
relationship, use of company equipment, and adherence to company
processes indicate employment rather than independent contractor
status. Under California's ABC test (Dynamex), the worker fails
prong B (work is within GrowthCo's usual course of business).
Misclassification exposes GrowthCo to significant liability
including back taxes, penalties, and potential class action.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STATEMENT OF FACTS

GrowthCo LLC engaged Sarah Chen as a "marketing consultant"
six months ago under a consulting agreement. The arrangement
includes:

- 30 hours/week of work, consistent schedule
- Exclusive engagement (no other clients)
- Use of GrowthCo laptop and software licenses
- Daily check-ins with marketing director
- Required attendance at team meetings
- Work performed at GrowthCo office 3 days/week
- Paid monthly flat fee of $8,000

GrowthCo's core business includes marketing services for clients.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DISCUSSION

I. IRS Common Law Test (Federal)

   A. Applicable Law

      The IRS uses a common law test examining three categories:
      (1) behavioral control, (2) financial control, and
      (3) relationship type. Rev. Rul. 87-41 provides 20 factors.

   B. Analysis

      Behavioral Control — Indicates Employee:
      ✗ Daily check-ins with supervisor
      ✗ Required attendance at meetings
      ✗ Must follow company processes
      ✗ Set schedule (30 hrs/week)

      Financial Control — Indicates Employee:
      ✗ Uses company equipment
      ✗ No investment in own tools
      ✗ Fixed monthly payment (not project-based)
      ✗ No opportunity for profit/loss

      Relationship Type — Indicates Employee:
      ✗ Ongoing, indefinite relationship
      ✗ Exclusive engagement
      ✗ Work is integral to business

   C. Risk Assessment: High

      Under the common law test, Sarah would likely be
      classified as an employee by the IRS. Risk of audit
      and reclassification is substantial.

II. California ABC Test

    A. Applicable Law

       Under Dynamex Operations West v. Superior Court (2018),
       codified in AB5 (Cal. Lab. Code § 2750.3), a worker is
       presumed to be an employee unless the hiring entity
       demonstrates all three prongs of the ABC test.

    B. Analysis

       (A) Free from control and direction — FAILS
           Sarah has daily check-ins, required meetings, and
           must follow company processes. GrowthCo exercises
           significant control.

       (B) Work outside usual course of business — FAILS
           GrowthCo provides marketing services to clients.
           Sarah's marketing work is squarely within GrowthCo's
           usual course of business. This is dispositive.

       (C) Customarily engaged in independent trade — FAILS
           Sarah works exclusively for GrowthCo and has no
           other clients. She does not operate an independent
           marketing business.

    C. Risk Assessment: High

       Sarah clearly fails all three prongs. Under California
       law, she must be classified as an employee.

III. Exposure Analysis

     Misclassification creates the following liabilities:

     | Category | Potential Liability |
     |----------|-------------------|
     | Back payroll taxes | ~15-20% of compensation |
     | FLSA overtime | 1.5x unpaid overtime + liquidated damages |
     | CA penalties | $5,000-25,000 per violation |
     | Benefits | Retroactive eligibility |
     | Class action | If pattern of misclassification |

     Six months of misclassification at $8,000/month = $48,000
     in compensation. Potential exposure: $50,000-100,000+.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION

Sarah Chen cannot properly be classified as an independent
contractor under either federal or California law. She should
be immediately converted to W-2 employee status. Continuing
the current arrangement creates substantial legal and financial
risk for GrowthCo.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. IMMEDIATE: Convert Sarah to W-2 employee status
2. Enroll in payroll system with proper withholding
3. Review all other contractor relationships for compliance
4. Consider voluntary classification settlement program (VCSP)
   with IRS to limit back-tax liability
5. Update consulting agreement templates to ensure proper
   structure for legitimate contractors
