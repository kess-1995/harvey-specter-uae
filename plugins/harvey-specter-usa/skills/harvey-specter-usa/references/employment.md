# Employment Law — US Practice

## Overview

This reference covers hiring, termination, compensation, workplace policies, and employee classification for US employers.

---

## At-Will Employment

### The Default Rule

**49 states + DC:** Employment is at-will
- Either party can terminate at any time
- For any reason (or no reason)
- With or without notice

**Exception:** Montana — requires good cause after probation

### Limitations on At-Will

Even in at-will states, you **cannot** terminate for:

1. **Discrimination** (protected class)
2. **Retaliation** (for protected activity)
3. **Breach of Contract** (if contract exists)
4. **Public Policy Violation** (varies by state)

### Implied Contract Exceptions

Courts may find implied contract from:
- Employee handbook language ("will only be terminated for cause")
- Verbal assurances of job security
- Course of dealing (progressive discipline always used)

**Best practice:** Include at-will disclaimer in:
- Offer letters
- Employee handbooks
- Annual acknowledgments

## Employee Classification

### Employee vs Independent Contractor

**Why it matters:**
- Employees: Withholding, benefits, FLSA, discrimination laws apply
- Contractors: None of the above, but misclassification = huge liability

**IRS Factors (Common Law Test):**

| Factor | Employee | Contractor |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Behavioral control | Company directs how | Worker controls method |
| Financial control | Company provides tools | Worker invests in tools |
| Relationship type | Ongoing, exclusive | Project-based, multiple clients |

**ABC Test (California, many states):**
Presumed employee unless:
- **(A)** Free from control and direction
- **(B)** Work outside usual course of business
- **(C)** Customarily engaged in independent trade

**California AB5:** Codified ABC test, expansive employee classification

### Exempt vs Non-Exempt

**FLSA requires overtime for non-exempt employees**

**Exempt (salary, no overtime) requires ALL of:**
1. Salary basis: ≥$684/week ($35,568/year) — 2024 threshold
2. Salary level: Paid fixed amount regardless of hours
3. Duties test: Executive, Administrative, Professional, Computer, or Outside Sales

**Duties Tests:**

| Exemption | Primary Duty |
|-----------|--------------|
| Executive | Managing enterprise/department, supervise 2+ employees |
| Administrative | Office/non-manual work, exercise discretion on significant matters |
| Professional | Advanced knowledge, prolonged specialized study |
| Computer | Systems analyst, programmer, software engineer ($27.63/hr min) |
| Outside Sales | Sales away from employer's place of business |

**Common mistakes:**
- Job title doesn't determine exemption (duties do)
- "Manager" who doesn't supervise = not executive exempt
- Paying salary doesn't make someone exempt

## Wage & Hour (FLSA)

### Minimum Wage

**Federal:** $7.25/hour (unchanged since 2009)

**State minimums (2024 examples):**
| State | Minimum |
|-------|---------|
| California | $16.00 |
| New York (NYC) | $16.00 |
| Washington | $16.28 |
| Texas | $7.25 (federal) |
| Florida | $13.00 |

**Tipped employees:** $2.13/hour federal (if tips bring to minimum)

### Overtime

**Non-exempt employees:**
- 1.5x regular rate for hours over 40/week
- California: Also daily overtime (over 8 hours/day)

**Calculating regular rate:**
- Include: Base pay, non-discretionary bonuses, commissions
- Exclude: Discretionary bonuses, gifts, expense reimbursements

### Recordkeeping

**Employers must maintain (3 years):**
- Hours worked each day
- Total hours each week
- Basis of pay (hourly, salary, etc.)
- Regular hourly rate
- Total wages per pay period
- Deductions

## Discrimination Laws

| ADEA | 20+ employees |
| EPA (Equal Pay) | All employers |
| FLSA | $500K revenue or interstate commerce |

**State laws often have lower thresholds**

### Discrimination Framework

**Disparate Treatment:**
- Intentional discrimination
- Direct evidence OR
- McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting:
  1. Plaintiff: Prima facie case
  2. Employer: Legitimate, non-discriminatory reason
  3. Plaintiff: Pretext

**Disparate Impact:**
- Neutral policy, discriminatory effect
- No intent required
- Employer defense: Business necessity

### Harassment

**Hostile Work Environment:**
- Unwelcome conduct
- Based on protected class
- Severe or pervasive
- Affects work environment

**Quid Pro Quo:**

- Or basis for employment decisions

**Employer Liability:**
- Supervisor harassment: Strict liability (with affirmative defense)
- Co-worker harassment: Negligence (knew or should have known)

## Termination

### Best Practices

**Before termination:**
1. Document performance issues
2. Follow progressive discipline (if policy exists)
3. Review for potential discrimination claims
4. Check for protected activity (recent complaints, leave)
5. Ensure consistency with similar situations

**At termination:**
1. Brief, direct meeting
2. Witness present (HR or manager)
3. Provide written documentation
4. Explain final pay and benefits
5. Collect company property
6. Escort from building (if appropriate)

**After termination:**
1. Process final paycheck (state deadlines vary)
2. Provide COBRA notice (if applicable)
3. Send separation agreement (if offering severance)
4. File unemployment response

### Final Pay Deadlines

| State | Voluntary Quit | Involuntary Termination |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| California | 72 hours (or immediately if 72 hours notice) | **Immediately** |
| New York | Next regular payday | Next regular payday |
| Texas | Next regular payday | Within 6 days |
| Illinois | Next regular payday | Next regular payday |
| Federal (FLSA) | Next regular payday | Next regular payday |

**California penalties:** Waiting time penalties = daily wages for up to 30 days

## Non-Compete Agreements

### State-by-State Enforceability

| State | Enforceability |
|-------|----------------|
| **California** | **NOT ENFORCEABLE** (Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600) |
| **North Dakota** | Not enforceable |
| **Oklahoma** | Not enforceable (limited exceptions) |
| **Minnesota** | Banned (effective 2023) |
| New York | Enforceable if reasonable |
| Texas | Enforceable with consideration |
| Florida | Enforceable, employer-friendly |
| Massachusetts | Enforceable, garden leave required |

### Reasonableness Factors

Where enforceable, courts consider:
1. **Duration**: 6 months - 2 years typical
2. **Geographic scope**: Limited to actual market
3. **Activity restricted**: Narrow to protectable interests
4. **Consideration**: Must receive something of value
5. **Hardship**: Balance employer need vs employee burden

### FTC Non-Compete Rule (2024)

**Proposed rule would ban most non-competes:**
- Effective date delayed by litigation
- Currently enjoined nationwide
- Future uncertain — monitor developments

**Alternative protections:**
- Non-solicitation (customers, employees)
- Confidentiality agreements
- Garden leave provisions
- Forfeiture-for-competition clauses
