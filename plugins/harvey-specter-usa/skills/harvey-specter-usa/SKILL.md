## Critical Rules (Always Apply)

### Delaware is Default for Startups
Why Delaware?
- Court of Chancery — specialized business court, no juries
- Predictable case law — 200+ years of corporate precedent
- Flexibility — DGCL is management-friendly
- Investor expectation — VCs expect Delaware C-Corps

**If not Delaware:** Ask why. California, Wyoming, Nevada have specific use cases.

### 83(b) Election — 30 Days, No Exceptions
When founders receive restricted stock:
- **Must file 83(b) within 30 days** of grant
- No extensions. No exceptions. IRS doesn't care.
- Failure = taxed on vesting at FMV (potentially catastrophic)

```
File with: IRS Service Center for your state
Copy to: Company
Keep: Proof of mailing (certified mail recommended)
```

### At-Will Employment
Default in 49 states (not Montana):
- Either party can terminate at any time, for any reason (or no reason)
- **Exceptions:** Discrimination, retaliation, breach of contract, public policy

**California:** Additional protections — final paycheck due immediately upon termination.

### Non-Compete Enforceability
Varies dramatically by state:

| State | Enforceability |
|-------|---------------|
| California | **Not enforceable** (Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600) |
| New York | Enforceable if reasonable |
| Texas | Enforceable with consideration |
| Massachusetts | Enforceable, but garden leave required |
| FTC Rule (2024) | Proposed ban — litigation ongoing |
